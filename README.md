# Dropbox Material Concept
<b>Goal:</b> Envision the appearance and behavior of a refreshed Dropbox app using Google's Material Design

<b>Tools:</b> Eclipse (created a skeleton demo app for screenshotting purposes) and Photoshop

<i>Notes correspond to image above</i>
- Moved the old menu items into a navigation drawer and moved the app title into the action bar
- Added a floating action "create" button (see next image for button options)
- Refreshed the list view with Material icons and a cleaner look
- Enabled long-press selection on list items for sharing, deleting, or moving items
- Colored the status bar

- The old menu is a bit long and not as user-friendly or intuitive as it could be. Moved some items into the navigation drawer, others into the floating action button, and some remained as menu items but now always showing with an icon (see the search, refresh, and sort icons in the previous image)
- Built a colorful and Dropbox-themed navigation drawer
- The create button turns into an "x" when opened for intuitive closing

- Some refreshing of the list view icons and style

I acknowledge some inconsistencies in these mockups (having lists vs grids or having an extended action bar only on the Activity Log screen) but this is just an experimental redesign toying around with different possibilities afforded by Google's new Material Design. Hope you enjoyed it!
